# Some Sprinkled Gear Notes

Both purple and golden gear, when fully strengthened, get base stats x3, but giving five stars to a golden piece is much more costly than getting a purple fully maxed out.

So, if the golden gear you have available doesn't have a base stat, for the stat you are interested, above 6, it isn't worth using it.

For example, for a Damage Dealing commander (a DD), you are interested in _Commander Attack_ stat, which for _Casque of Pride_ is 16, 16 x 3 = 48, awesome. The next helmet in line for _Commander Attack_ stat is _Berserker's Gaze_, with 9 points, so 9 x 3 = 27, still good. Then it comes _Chieftain's Gaze_ with 6 base points, 6 x 3 = 18. But you can get 18 with a purple _Full Helm_. 

So it is a waste of gear resources to improve a _Chieftain's Gaze_. **DO NOT DO IT!**

## On Stars

- 1 star  1 gear
- 2 stars 2 gears
- 3 stars 3 gears
- 4 stars 5 gears
- 5 stars 8 gears

So you need 20 purple pieces to get from a stat 6 to 18.
