# Flying Strategies by Radiant

1. Always have a stash of 400 to 800 birds for bombing siege stacks or building
   Fortresses.

2. Always max upgrade your fighting forts. Make two if needed, or a Tactical
   Fort.

3. Never reinforce the normal way. Always put your troops on a one command
   commander, Merry and Pippin preferably, and send them to transport troops to
   your fort. That way if they get sniped the troops don't go to the hospital.

4. Always send your combat or cleaning formations to your fort with one Eagle
   on each commander. Fill up when online.

5. Remove troops from your formations before going to bed, especially siege.
   This applies to your city as well. This will send them into recuperation, so
   do it when you are going to be offline for several hours.

6. Always take road tiles in combat zones, as well as any tiles beneath the
   reinforcement lines. Build forts or Resource Centers along those lines.

7. A level 45 siege team with siege gear can take an enemy crossing with enough
   hits, only one other formation is needed to help occupy, preferably with
   full stamina.

8. Keep an eye on stamina, use stamina pots if necessary to stay above 100
   stamina.

9. Always be on lookout for great sniping locations and strategic places to
   build your forts.

10. Use 1 commander Eagle formations to spam low level tiles. Unless the tiles
    are on Gale areas.

11. **ALWAYS PROTECT YOUR BUILDING TEMP CAMP**. Use emergency construction to
    shave 2 hours off the build timer. Save it for when it's just about done
    and you can move, so that if it's destroyed you didn't waste AP.

12. Design your resource gathering according to what flying unit you will use:
  - Eagles: Wood and Grain.
  - Fellbeasts: Ore and Grain.

**ToDo:**
- add what's needed to take neutral road tile and an enemy road tile.
- add what's needed to take an Eyrie only with birds. From what I recall, a single hitter army that can take both defenders and 5 flying-sieging armies.
- add what's needed to take down an enemy Fortress.
- add what's needed to take down a temporal camp fully built.
