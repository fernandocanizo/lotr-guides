# Early Farming Guide

Basic guide for farming first 24 hour. Goldfish, dolphin, whale, kraken might need to adapt.

First thing entering you need to build is your apothecary.

Don’t start taking tiles right away, get buildings going and wait for ring level 10 to unlock _Command Arts_ to get your 3rd commander into your formation.

Take one level 2 or 3 tile with your A army. Take one level 2 or 3 tile with your B army. This is just to use stamina on those two.

Start running C, D, E, etc. armies (goldfish accounts may not have E armies but you get the trick I guess) on the battlefield to get level 3-6 tiles to advance chapters and get resources. Use the ring ability _Time Control_ to speed up buildings.

Use your A and B armies with 3 formations **ONLY** to sweep mobs until they are level 20 and you can put all equipment on them. This is by far the fastest way to level them quickly. Yes, first 3-6 hrs. might be slower than using A/B right away, but you save stamina for later and can start taking higher tiles with them.

Don’t forget you need at least 1 tank in each formation and 2 dds and you need to swap around gear.

Use Ring Action Points (RAP) for gathering as soon as possible. 5 RAP should be used on a level 7 stone tile as soon as the gathering is unlocked.

Upgrade the needed buildings to progress chapters. 4 formations per army will only unlock on day 2. Use clairvoyance for easy matchups to take 1 level 8 tile and 1 level 9 tile of each Ressource type before the first 24 hours have concluded. Then you are on track.

**OPTIONAL**
If you’re account is on the stronger side, using your tank commander with full troops snd your 2 DD with only one troop method CAN be best. Not possible for small accounts.
